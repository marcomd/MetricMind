# Git Productivity Analytics Dashboard

An AI-driven developer productivity analytics system that extracts, stores, and visualizes git commit data from multiple repositories to measure the impact of development tools and practices.

![Cover](assets/MetricMindCover_ruby.jpg)

## Overview

This system provides comprehensive analytics to answer questions like:
- How do commit patterns change over time?
- What's the impact of new AI tools on developer productivity?
- Which contributors are most active across projects?
- How do different repositories compare in terms of activity?

## Quick Start

### Complete Setup in 4 Steps

```bash
# 1. Run automated setup
./scripts/setup.rb

# 2. Edit configuration files
vim .env                        # Database credentials (if needed)
vim config/repositories.json    # Add your repositories

# 3. Extract and analyze
./scripts/run.rb                # Automatic extraction, loading, categorization

# 4. Query your data
psql -d git_analytics -c "SELECT * FROM v_category_stats;"
```

That's it! The system automatically handles schema setup via migrations, data extraction, commit categorization, weight calculation, and view optimization.

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ Database creation and schema initialization via Sequel migrations
- ✅ Auto-detection and seeding for existing databases from SQL files
- ✅ All schema managed through unified migration system (tables, views, indexes)
- ✅ Git data extraction from all repositories (with full commit messages)
- ✅ AI tools extraction from commit bodies
- ✅ Commit categorization (business domain extraction)
- ✅ Weight calculation (revert detection for accurate metrics)
- ✅ Materialized view refresh (weighted and unweighted metrics)

The setup procedure supports two modes:

Full Setup Mode (default):
`./scripts/setup.rb`

- [1/6] Check prerequisites (Ruby, PostgreSQL)
- [2/6] Install Ruby dependencies
- [3/6] Create .env file
- [4/6] Create databases (production + test)
- [5/6] Initialize schemas + migrations + views
- [6/6] Create data directories

Database-Only Mode:
`./scripts/setup.rb --database-only`

- [1/3] Check PostgreSQL only
- [2/3] Create databases (production + test)
- [3/3] Initialize schemas + migrations + views

---

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Ruby** >= 3.3 ([Installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/))
- **PostgreSQL** >= 12 ([Installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/))
- **Git repositories** to analyze

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is using the automated setup script:

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd MetricMind

# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/setup.rb
```

**What this script does:**
1. ✅ Checks prerequisites (Ruby, PostgreSQL)
2. ✅ Installs Ruby dependencies (`bundle install`)
3. ✅ Creates `.env` file from template
4. ✅ Creates production and test databases
5. ✅ Initializes database schema and views (including migrations)
6. ✅ Creates necessary directories (`data/exports/`)

After the script completes, you'll be prompted to:
- Edit your `.env` file with database credentials (if needed)
- Configure repositories in `config/repositories.json`

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup or need more control:

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
```

#### 2. Database Setup

```bash
# Run database-only setup (creates database and applies all migrations)
./scripts/setup.rb --database-only
```

This will:
- Create the database if it doesn't exist
- Auto-detect existing databases from SQL files and seed schema_migrations table
- Apply all Sequel migrations in chronological order (tables, columns, views, indexes)
- All schema changes are managed through the unified migration system

**Note:** This skips Ruby dependencies and .env setup. Use `./scripts/setup.rb` (without flags) for complete first-time setup.

#### 3. Database Migrations

The project uses [Sequel](https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) for database migrations with version tracking and rollback support.

```bash
# Check migration status
./scripts/db_migrate_status.rb

# Apply pending migrations
./scripts/db_migrate.rb

# Create new migration
./scripts/db_migrate_new.rb add_new_column

# Rollback last migration
./scripts/db_rollback.rb
```

**Migration tracking:**
- Applied migrations are tracked in the `schema_migrations` table
- Each migration runs only once (idempotent by design)
- Migrations use timestamp format: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.rb`
- Full rollback support via `up` and `down` blocks

See the [Schema Migrations](#schema-migrations) section in CLAUDE.md for detailed documentation.

#### 4. Configure Repositories

Edit `config/repositories.json` to add your repositories:

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "name": "my-backend",
      "path": "/absolute/path/to/repo",
      "description": "Backend API",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "my-frontend",
      "path": "/absolute/path/to/frontend",
      "description": "React Frontend",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Database connection and extraction settings are configured via `.env` file (see Environment Variables section below). The `config/repositories.json` file only contains the list of repositories to track.

### Extract and Load Data

```bash
# Run extraction and loading for all configured repositories
./scripts/run.rb

# Or run for specific date range
./scripts/run.rb --from "1 year ago" --to "now"

# Process single repository
./scripts/run.rb mater

# Clean before processing (useful for fixing duplicate data)
./scripts/run.rb --clean
```

The `run.rb` script automatically:
- Extracts git data from repositories (including full commit messages)
- **Categorizes commits with AI** during extraction (extracts business domains, generates descriptions, calculates business impact)
- Extracts AI tools information from commit bodies
- Loads data into the database
- **Calculates commit weights** (detects and marks reverted commits)
- **Refreshes materialized views** (for fast dashboard queries with weighted metrics)

No additional steps needed - everything runs automatically!

**What's included:**
- ✅ Git data extraction from all configured repositories
- ✅ **AI categorization during extraction** (category, description, confidence, business_impact)
- ✅ AI tools tracking (extracts tools like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot from commit bodies)
- ✅ Database loading with duplicate prevention (UPSERT updates existing records)
- ✅ **Weight calculation** (detects revert/unrevert patterns and adjusts commit weights for accurate productivity metrics)
- ✅ **Materialized view refresh** (ensures dashboard queries are fast, includes both weighted and unweighted metrics)

See sections below for details on:
- [Commit Categorization](#commit-categorization)
- [Weight Calculation (Revert Detection)](#weight-calculation-revert-detection)
- [AI Tools Tracking](#ai-tools-tracking)

## Usage

### Single Repository Extraction

Extract git data from a single repository:

```bash
./scripts/git_extract_to_json.rb FROM_DATE TO_DATE OUTPUT_FILE [REPO_NAME] [REPO_PATH]
```

Examples:
```bash
# Extract last 6 months from current repository
./scripts/git_extract_to_json.rb "6 months ago" "now" "data/my-repo.json"

# Extract specific date range from another repository
./scripts/git_extract_to_json.rb "2025-01-01" "2025-12-31" "data/backend.json" "backend-api" "/path/to/repo"
```

### Working with Large Date Ranges

When extracting years of history, AI enrichment can be slow and expensive. Use this approach:

```bash
# Stage 1: Fast extraction of full history without AI
./scripts/run.rb --skip-ai --from "10 years ago" --to "now"

# Stage 2: Re-run with AI for recent commits only
./scripts/run.rb --from "3 months ago" --to "now"
```

This workflow:
1. Extracts all commits without AI categorization (fast)
2. Re-runs extraction with AI for recent commits (updates existing records)
3. Saves time and API costs by focusing AI on relevant data

### Load Data to Database

Load JSON export into PostgreSQL:

```bash
./scripts/load_json_to_db.rb JSON_FILE
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/load_json_to_db.rb data/my-repo.json
```

### Multi-Repository Processing

Process multiple repositories automatically:

```bash
# Extract and load all enabled repositories (default config)
./scripts/run.rb

# Use custom config file
./scripts/run.rb --config config/my-repos.json

# Override date range
./scripts/run.rb --from "3 months ago" --to "now"

# Process single repository
./scripts/run.rb mater

# Advanced workflows
./scripts/run.rb --clean                    # Clean all repos before processing
./scripts/run.rb mater --clean              # Clean single repo before processing
./scripts/run.rb --skip-load                # Only extract to JSON (no database)
./scripts/run.rb --skip-extraction          # Only load from existing JSON files
./scripts/run.rb mater --from "2024-01-01" --to "2024-12-31"
```

## Database Schema

### Tables

#### `repositories`
Stores metadata about tracked repositories.

| name | VARCHAR(255) | Repository name (unique) |
| url | TEXT | Repository URL or path |
| description | TEXT | Optional description |
| last_extracted_at | TIMESTAMP | Last extraction timestamp |

#### `commits`
Stores per-commit data (granular level).

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | SERIAL | Primary key |
| repository_id | INTEGER | Foreign key to repositories |

### Refreshing Materialized Views

After loading new data, refresh materialized views:

```sql
-- Refresh all standard materialized views (includes personal trends)
SELECT refresh_all_mv();

-- Refresh all category materialized views (includes personal categories)
SELECT refresh_category_mv();

-- Refresh only personal performance views
SELECT refresh_personal_mv();
```

Or manually:
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_stats_by_repo;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_stats_by_author;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_category_stats;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_category_stats_by_author;
```

**Note:** When using `./scripts/run.rb`, materialized views are refreshed automatically.

## Query Examples

### Monthly trends for a specific repository

```sql
SELECT
    year_month,
    total_commits,
    total_lines_changed,
    unique_authors,
    avg_lines_changed_per_commit,
    avg_commits_per_author
FROM mv_monthly_stats_by_repo
WHERE repository_name = 'backend-api'
ORDER BY month_start_date DESC;
```

### Top contributors across all repositories

```sql
SELECT
    author_name,
    total_commits,
    repositories_contributed,
    total_lines_changed,
    avg_lines_changed_per_commit
FROM v_contributor_stats
ORDER BY total_commits DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Daily activity for last 30 days

```sql
SELECT
    commit_date,
    repository_name,
    total_commits,
    total_lines_changed,
    unique_authors
FROM v_daily_stats_by_repo
WHERE commit_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY commit_date DESC;
```

### Compare repositories

```sql
SELECT
    repository_name,
    SUM(total_commits) as commits,
    SUM(total_lines_changed) as lines_changed,
    COUNT(DISTINCT year_month) as months_active,
    AVG(unique_authors) as avg_authors_per_month
FROM mv_monthly_stats_by_repo
WHERE month_start_date >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY repository_name
ORDER BY commits DESC;
```

### Before/After analysis (e.g., AI tool adoption)

```sql
-- Before AI tools (e.g., July-August 2025)
SELECT
    AVG(avg_lines_changed_per_commit) as avg_lines_per_commit,
    AVG(total_commits) as avg_commits_per_month,
    AVG(unique_authors) as avg_authors
FROM mv_monthly_stats_by_repo
WHERE month_start_date BETWEEN '2025-07-01' AND '2025-08-31'
    AND repository_name = 'backend-api';

-- After AI tools (e.g., September-October 2025)
SELECT
    AVG(avg_lines_changed_per_commit) as avg_lines_per_commit,
    AVG(total_commits) as avg_commits_per_month,
    AVG(unique_authors) as avg_authors
FROM mv_monthly_stats_by_repo
WHERE month_start_date BETWEEN '2025-09-01' AND '2025-10-31'
    AND repository_name = 'backend-api';
```

### Weight efficiency analysis

Compare raw commits vs effective commits to understand the impact of weight adjustments:

```sql
-- Repository weight efficiency over time
SELECT
    repository_name,
    year_month,
    total_commits,
    effective_commits,
    avg_weight,
    weight_efficiency_pct,
    total_lines_changed,
    weighted_lines_changed
FROM mv_monthly_stats_by_repo
WHERE month_start_date >= '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY repository_name, year_month DESC;
```

### Weight efficiency by repository

See which repositories have the most weight adjustments:

```sql
-- Repositories ranked by weight efficiency
SELECT
    repository_name,
    SUM(total_commits) as total_commits,
    ROUND(SUM(effective_commits), 2) as effective_commits,
    ROUND(AVG(weight_efficiency_pct), 1) as avg_efficiency_pct,
    ROUND((SUM(total_commits) - SUM(effective_commits))::numeric, 2) as discounted_commits
FROM mv_monthly_stats_by_repo
GROUP BY repository_name
HAVING AVG(weight_efficiency_pct) < 100
ORDER BY discounted_commits DESC;
```

### Personal performance (for logged-in users)

Query personal metrics using the logged-in user's email address:

```sql
-- Personal commit history (most recent commits)
SELECT
    commit_date,
    repository_name,
    hash,
    subject,
    lines_changed,
    weight,
    category,
    ai_tools
FROM v_personal_commit_details
WHERE author_email = 'user@example.com'
ORDER BY commit_date DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Personal commits with filtering (specific repository and date range)
SELECT
    commit_date,
    repository_name,
    subject,
    lines_changed,
    category
FROM v_personal_commit_details
WHERE author_email = 'user@example.com'
  AND repository_name = 'backend-api'
  AND commit_date >= '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY commit_date DESC;

-- Personal commits by category (e.g., all BILLING commits)
SELECT
    commit_date,
    repository_name,
    subject,
    lines_changed,
    weight
FROM v_personal_commit_details
WHERE author_email = 'user@example.com'
  AND category = 'BILLING'
ORDER BY commit_date DESC;

-- Personal monthly trends
SELECT
    year_month,
    repository_name,
    total_commits,
    total_lines_changed,
    effective_commits,
    avg_weight,
    weight_efficiency_pct
FROM mv_monthly_stats_by_author
WHERE author_email = 'user@example.com'
ORDER BY month_start_date DESC;

-- Personal daily activity (last 30 days)
SELECT
    commit_date,
    repository_name,
    total_commits,
    total_lines_changed,
    weighted_lines_changed
FROM v_daily_stats_by_author
WHERE author_email = 'user@example.com'
  AND commit_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY commit_date DESC;

-- Personal category breakdown
SELECT
    category,
    total_commits,
    effective_commits,
    weighted_lines_changed,
    weight_efficiency_pct,
    repositories
FROM v_category_stats_by_author
WHERE author_email = 'user@example.com'
ORDER BY total_commits DESC;

-- Personal category trends over time
SELECT
    year_month,
    category,
    total_commits,
    weighted_lines_changed,
    avg_lines_per_commit
FROM mv_monthly_category_stats_by_author
WHERE author_email = 'user@example.com'
ORDER BY month_start_date DESC, total_commits DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

          "added": 30,
          "deleted": 15
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/git_extract_to_json_spec.rb

# Run with documentation format
bundle exec rspec --format documentation
```

## Environment Variables

Configure via `.env` file or environment:

```bash
# Database connection
# Option 1: Use DATABASE_URL (recommended for remote/hosted databases like Neon, Heroku, etc.)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require

# Option 2: Use individual connection parameters (local development)
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=git_analytics
PGUSER=your_username
PGPASSWORD=your_password

# Note: DATABASE_URL takes priority over individual parameters if both are set

# PostgreSQL Test Database Configuration
PGDATABASE_TEST=git_analytics_test

# Optional: Default extraction dates
DEFAULT_FROM_DATE="6 months ago"
DEFAULT_TO_DATE="now"

# Optional: Output directory
OUTPUT_DIR=./data/exports
```

## Deployment

### Local Development

1. Run PostgreSQL locally
2. Initialize database schema
3. Configure repositories
4. Run extraction

### Production (Cloud)

1. **Database**: Use managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Heroku Postgres, Neon)
2. **Extraction**: Run as scheduled job (cron, GitHub Actions, Cloud Scheduler)
3. **Dashboard**: Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or keep on Replit

#### Using Remote PostgreSQL (e.g., Neon)

For cloud-hosted PostgreSQL services, use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

```bash
# In your .env file or CI/CD environment
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
```

This is the recommended approach for services like:
- **Neon** - Serverless PostgreSQL
- **Heroku Postgres** - Managed PostgreSQL on Heroku
- **Supabase** - Open source Firebase alternative
- **Railway** - Modern deployment platform

The connection string includes SSL configuration which is typically required by hosted services.

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Extract Git Data
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday at 2 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  extract:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.2'
      - run: bundle install
      - run: ./scripts/run.rb
        env:
          PGHOST: ${{ secrets.PGHOST }}
          PGDATABASE: ${{ secrets.PGDATABASE }}
          PGUSER: ${{ secrets.PGUSER }}
          PGPASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGPASSWORD }}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database connection errors

```bash
# Test connection
psql -h $PGHOST -U $PGUSER -d $PGDATABASE -c "SELECT version();"

# Check if database exists
psql -l | grep git_analytics
```

### Schema not initialized

```bash
# Reinitialize schema
psql -d git_analytics -f schema/postgres_schema.sql
psql -d git_analytics -f schema/postgres_views.sql
```

### No commits extracted

- Verify git repository path is correct
- Check date range includes commits: `git log --since="FROM" --until="TO" --oneline`
- Ensure you're on the correct branch

### Duplicate commits and re-loading data

The system now uses **UPSERT functionality** (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`) to handle duplicate commits intelligently. This means:

- **New commits**: Will be inserted as usual
- **Existing commits**: Will be updated with new data (AI-generated fields, categories, weights, etc.)
- **Re-running extraction is safe**: You can re-process any time period to update commit data

This is particularly useful for:
- Backfilling new fields (description, business_impact) after enabling AI categorization
- Updating subjects after fixing bugs in the extraction process
- Recalculating weights based on new business impact assessments
- Regenerating AI categorizations with improved prompts

**Example use cases:**

```bash
# Re-process October to backfill AI-generated fields (description, business_impact)
./scripts/run.rb --from "2024-10-01" --to "2024-10-31"

# Re-process last 3 months for a specific repository
./scripts/run.rb mater --from "3 months ago" --to "now"

# The loader will show statistics:
#   Commits inserted: 50   (new commits)
#   Commits updated: 120   (existing commits with updated data)
```

**What gets updated:**
- AI-generated fields: `category`, `description`, `business_impact`, `ai_confidence`
- Commit weights: `weight`, `ai_tools`
- Subject line (in case of extraction bugfixes)

**What stays unchanged:**
- Original commit metadata: `commit_date`, `author_name`, `author_email`
- Git statistics: `lines_added`, `lines_deleted`, `files_changed`

If you need to completely clean and reload data for a repository:

```bash
# Clean and reload single repository (prompts for confirmation)
./scripts/run.rb mater --clean

# Or use the cleanup script directly
./scripts/clean_repository.rb mater
```

## Commit Categorization

The categorization feature analyzes commit messages to understand **what** business domains developers are working on. AI categorization happens **during extraction** for maximum accuracy.

### Overview

Categorization extracts **business domain categories** from commit subjects, enabling insights into resource allocation across different areas of your product (e.g., BILLING, CS, INFRA).

**Note:** Categorization runs **automatically** during extraction as part of `./scripts/run.rb`. Categories are scoped per repository for consistency.

### Extraction-Time AI Categorization

When AI is enabled, categorization happens during git extraction with access to:
- Commit subject (message)
- **Modified file paths** (strong signal, e.g., `app/jobs/billing/*` → BILLING)
- **Git diff content** (actual code changes for context)
- Existing categories from the same repository (ensures consistency)

**What AI generates per commit:**
- 🏷️ **Category** - Business domain (e.g., BILLING, SECURITY, API)
- 📝 **Description** - 2-4 sentence summary of changes
- 📊 **Confidence** - How confident the AI is (0-100)
- 💼 **Business Impact** - Value assessment (LOW 0-50, MEDIUM 51-99, HIGH 100)

**Pattern-based fallback:**
If AI is not enabled, pattern matching extracts categories from commit subjects:
1. **Pipe delimiter**: `BILLING | Implemented payment gateway` → **BILLING**
2. **Square brackets**: `[CS] Fixed widget display` → **CS**
3. **First uppercase word**: `BILLING Implemented feature` → **BILLING**

**Supported Providers:**
- **Ollama** (free, local) - Run models like llama3.2, mistral, codellama on your machine
- **Google Gemini** (cloud, API key required) - Fast and accurate cloud-based categorization
- **Anthropic Claude** (cloud, API key required) - Advanced reasoning and high-quality categorization

### Getting Started with AI Categorization

#### First-Time Setup

1. **Choose your provider and configure `.env`:**

**Option A: Ollama (Local, Free)**
```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama  # macOS
# or download from https://ollama.ai

# Start Ollama and pull a model
ollama serve  # In one terminal
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b  # In another terminal

# Configure in .env
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
OLLAMA_TEMPERATURE=0.1
PREVENT_NUMERIC_CATEGORIES=true  # Prevents version numbers like "2.58.0"
```

**Option B: Google Gemini (Cloud)**
```bash
# Get API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

# Configure in .env
AI_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
GEMINI_TEMPERATURE=0.1
PREVENT_NUMERIC_CATEGORIES=true  # Prevents version numbers like "2.58.0"
```

**Option C: Anthropic Claude (Cloud)**
```bash
# Get API key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

# Configure in .env
AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5           # Recommended: Use alias (claude-haiku-4-5 cheapest, claude-sonnet-4-5 balanced)
                                           # Or dated: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001, claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
ANTHROPIC_TEMPERATURE=0.1
PREVENT_NUMERIC_CATEGORIES=true  # Prevents version numbers like "2.58.0"
```

2. **Apply database migration:**
```bash
# Run setup to apply the AI categorization migration
./scripts/setup.rb --database-only
```

3. **Run the pipeline:**
```bash
# AI categorization runs automatically during extraction if AI_PROVIDER is set
./scripts/run.rb

# Or test on a single repository
./scripts/run.rb mater
```

#### Scenario: Adding AI to Existing Data

If you already have data in your database and want to add AI categorization:

```bash
# 1. Configure AI provider in .env (see above)

# 2. Re-run extraction for the date range you want to categorize
# This will UPSERT existing commits with new AI-generated fields
./scripts/run.rb --from "3 months ago" --to "now"

# 3. Check results
psql -d git_analytics -c "
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE category IS NOT NULL) as categorized,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ai_confidence IS NOT NULL) as ai_categorized,
    ROUND(AVG(ai_confidence) FILTER (WHERE ai_confidence IS NOT NULL), 1) as avg_confidence
  FROM commits;
"
```

#### Scenario: Recategorizing Existing Data

To re-run AI categorization (e.g., after improving prompts or switching providers), simply re-extract:

```bash
# Re-extract to update AI fields (UPSERT updates existing commits)
./scripts/run.rb --from "3 months ago" --to "now"

# Or for a specific repository
./scripts/run.rb mater --from "3 months ago"
```

**Note:** Re-extraction will update AI-generated fields (category, description, business_impact, ai_confidence) while preserving original commit metadata.

### Numeric Category Prevention

By default, the system prevents creation of invalid categories.

What Gets Rejected:
  - ❌ Version numbers: `2.26.0`, `1.2.3`, `2.58.0`
  - ❌ Issue numbers: `#5930`, `#6802`, `#117`
  - ❌ Pure numbers: `2023`, `123`, `42`
  - ❌ Anything with #: `#HASHTAG`, `#TAG`
  - ❌ Too many digits: `12345ABC` (>50% digits)

What Gets Accepted:
  - ✅ Business categories: BILLING, CS, SECURITY, API
  - ✅ Technical terms: I18N, L10N, OAUTH2, HTTP2
  - ✅ Number-prefixed: 2FA, 3D, 3D_RENDERING ← NEW!
  - ✅ Anything with ≤50% digits and at least one letter

✅ Valid categories: `BILLING`, `SECURITY`, `DOCKER`, `API`, `DATABASE`

**Configuration:**
```bash
# .env
PREVENT_NUMERIC_CATEGORIES=true  # Default: true (recommended)

# To allow numeric categories (not recommended):
PREVENT_NUMERIC_CATEGORIES=false
```

The AI is explicitly instructed to avoid these patterns, and validation is enforced at the code level.

### Checking Coverage

```bash
# Check categorization coverage
psql -d git_analytics -c "
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_commits,
    COUNT(category) as categorized,
    ROUND(COUNT(category)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as category_pct
  FROM commits;
"

# View category distribution
psql -d git_analytics -c "SELECT * FROM v_category_stats ORDER BY total_commits DESC;"

# Find uncategorized commits
psql -d git_analytics -c "SELECT * FROM v_uncategorized_commits LIMIT 20;"
```

### Insights Enabled

With categorization, you can answer:
- "How much effort went into BILLING vs CS last quarter?"
- "Which business domains are receiving most attention?"
- "Are certain areas neglected?"
- "How has effort distribution changed over time?"
- "Which categories need more resources?"

### Improving Coverage

To improve categorization coverage:

1. **Standardize commit message format** - Encourage your team to use consistent prefixes:
   ```
   BILLING | Description
   CS | Description
   INFRA | Description
   ```

2. **Update old commits manually** if needed:
   ```sql
   -- Categorize commits containing "billing" keyword
   UPDATE commits SET category = 'BILLING'
   WHERE subject ILIKE '%billing%' AND category IS NULL;

   -- Categorize commits containing "customer service" or "cs"
   UPDATE commits SET category = 'CS'
   WHERE (subject ILIKE '%customer service%' OR subject ILIKE '% cs %')
     AND category IS NULL;
   ```

3. **Document your categories** - Create a team guideline listing all valid categories

### Database Views

Leverage existing views and materialized views:

- `mv_monthly_stats_by_repo` - Pre-computed monthly statistics
- `v_contributor_stats` - Aggregated contributor data
- `v_daily_stats_by_repo` - Daily activity aggregations
- `v_commit_details` - Detailed commit information with repository joins

Categorization creates these views:

- `v_category_stats` - Category statistics across all repos
- `v_category_by_repo` - Category breakdown per repository
- `mv_monthly_category_stats` - Monthly category trends (materialized)
- `v_uncategorized_commits` - Commits missing categories

### Maintenance

**Note:** When you run `./scripts/run.rb`, categorization and view refresh happen **automatically**. No manual maintenance needed!

If you need to manually refresh views (e.g., after manual database updates):
```bash
# Refresh materialized views
psql -d git_analytics -c "SELECT refresh_category_mv();"
```

## Weight Calculation (Revert Detection)

The weight calculation feature tracks commit validity by detecting reverted commits, enabling **accurate productivity metrics** that exclude work that was later reverted.

### Overview

Commits have a `weight` field (0-100) that reflects their validity:
- **weight = 100**: Valid commit (default)
- **weight = 0**: Excluded commit from weighted metrics (e.g. the reverted ones)

This allows analytics to distinguish between:
- **Total metrics**: All commits, including reverted ones
- **Weighted metrics**: Only valid work (reverted commits weighted at 0)

**Note:** Weight calculation runs **automatically** as part of `./scripts/run.rb`. No manual intervention needed!

### How It Works

The system detects revert patterns in commit subjects and automatically adjusts weights:

**Example workflow:**
```
1. CS | Move HTML content (!10463)              → weight = 100 (valid)
2. Revert "CS | Move HTML content (!10463)"     → weight = 0 (revert)
   ↳ Also sets commit #1 to weight = 0 (because it was reverted)
3. Unrevert !10463 and fix error (!10660)       → weight = 100 (valid)
   ↳ Unrevert commit contains the work from commit #1, so it counts once
   ↳ Commit #1 stays at weight = 0 to avoid double-counting
```

**Detection logic:**
- **"Revert" keyword**: Identifies revert commits (case-insensitive)
- **PR/MR numbers**: Links reverts to original commits via `(!12345)` or `(#12345)`
- **"Unrevert" keyword**: Prevents unrevert commits from being treated as reverts (they keep weight = 100)

**Important:** When a commit is unreverted, the unrevert commit itself contains all the work from the original commit (often with additional fixes). The original commit stays at weight=0 to prevent double-counting the same work.

### Manual Usage (Optional)

Weight calculation runs automatically with `./scripts/run.rb`, but you can also run it manually:

```bash
# Calculate weights for all commits
./scripts/calculate_commit_weights.rb

# Preview changes without applying (dry-run)
./scripts/calculate_commit_weights.rb --dry-run

# Calculate weights for specific repository only
./scripts/calculate_commit_weights.rb --repo mater
```

### Querying Weighted Metrics

All analytics views include both weighted and unweighted metrics:

```sql
-- Compare unweighted vs weighted lines changed
SELECT
  repository_name,
  year_month,
  total_lines_changed,           -- All commits
  weighted_lines_changed         -- Excluding reverted work
FROM mv_monthly_stats_by_repo
WHERE repository_name = 'MyApp'
ORDER BY year_month DESC;

-- Find all reverted commits
SELECT * FROM v_reverted_commits
ORDER BY commit_date DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Calculate revert rate
SELECT
  COUNT(CASE WHEN weight = 0 THEN 1 END) as reverted,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN weight = 0 THEN 1 END)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as revert_pct
FROM commits;
```

### Benefits

- **Accurate productivity metrics**: Exclude reverted work from calculations
- **Quality insights**: Track revert rates to measure code quality
- **Before/after analysis**: Compare weighted vs unweighted metrics to assess tool impact
- **Team health**: High revert rates may indicate rushed work or insufficient testing

## AI Tools Tracking

The AI tools tracking feature automatically extracts information about AI development tools used for each commit, enabling **direct measurement of AI tool impact on productivity**.

### Overview

Commits can include AI tool information in their message body:
- Extracted automatically during git data extraction
- Stored in the `ai_tools` field (VARCHAR, nullable)
- Normalized to uppercase for consistency (e.g., "CLAUDE CODE", "CURSOR", "GITHUB COPILOT")

**Note:** AI tools are extracted **automatically** during data extraction. Simply include tool information in commit messages!

### Commit Message Format

To track AI tool usage, include this format in your commit message **body** (not subject):

```
Your commit subject here

**AI tool: Claude Code**

Rest of commit description...
```

**Supported formats:**
- `**AI tool: Claude Code**`
- `**AI tools: Claude Code and Copilot**`
- `**AI tool: Cursor and GitHub Copilot**`
- `AI tool: Claude Code` (without asterisks)
- Case-insensitive

**Supported tools** (automatically normalized):
- Claude Code
- Claude
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot / Copilot
- Any custom tool name (will be uppercased)

### Querying AI Tools Data

Use the AI tools views for analysis:

```sql
-- Overall AI tools usage statistics
SELECT * FROM v_ai_tools_stats
ORDER BY total_commits DESC;

-- AI tools usage by repository
SELECT * FROM v_ai_tools_by_repo
WHERE repository_name = 'MyApp'
ORDER BY total_commits DESC;

-- Compare productivity with/without AI tools
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN ai_tools IS NOT NULL THEN 'With AI Tools'
    ELSE 'Without AI Tools'
  END as tool_usage,
  COUNT(*) as commits,
  ROUND(AVG(lines_added + lines_deleted), 1) as avg_lines_per_commit,
  ROUND(SUM((lines_added + lines_deleted) * weight / 100.0), 0) as total_weighted_lines
FROM commits
GROUP BY (CASE WHEN ai_tools IS NOT NULL THEN 'With AI Tools' ELSE 'Without AI Tools' END);

-- Monthly trend of AI tool adoption
SELECT
  TO_CHAR(commit_date, 'YYYY-MM') as month,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ai_tools IS NOT NULL) as with_ai,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ai_tools IS NOT NULL)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as ai_usage_pct
FROM commits
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(commit_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

### Benefits

- **Measure AI impact**: Directly compare productivity metrics with/without AI tools
- **Tool comparison**: Evaluate different AI tools' effectiveness
- **Adoption tracking**: Monitor AI tool usage trends over time
- **ROI analysis**: Quantify the impact of AI tool investment
- **Team insights**: Identify which developers benefit most from AI tools

### Best Practices

1. **Consistent format**: Train your team to use the standard `**AI tool: ...**` format
2. **Commit body, not subject**: Place AI tool info in the commit body, not the subject line
3. **Be specific**: List all tools used (e.g., "Claude Code and GitHub Copilot")
4. **Regular usage**: Add AI tool info whenever applicable to build comprehensive data

## Use the AI from the console

```ruby
require_relative 'lib/llm/client_factory'
RubyLLM.chat(model: "gemma3", provider: :ollama, assume_model_exists: true)
```

## Building the Dashboard

This section provides functional requirements and specifications for building an interactive analytics dashboard.

### Dashboard Purpose

This is the dashboard for MetricMind project in which we collect data from various git repositories to provide an overview of our progress.
The dashboard should provide an intuitive, visually appealing interface to explore git productivity metrics and answer key questions:
- How is productivity trending over time?
  - Overview
    - Totals (repositories, commits, contributors)
    - Repositories detail: description, Commits, Contributors, last update
    - repositories comparison
  - The commits trend for all repository or a selected one
  - A line chart "Lines Changed vs Added vs Deleted" 
  - Three cards: "Avg Commits/Month", "Avg Lines/Commit", "Avg Contributors/Month"
  - Filters: repository, the period (last 3, 6, 12, 24 months, all), a checkox per committer
    - per committer means, for example, if the trend shows the 200 commits at "2025-10" for "All repositories" -> if the user clicks on the checkbox "per commmitter" and supposing the total number of committers is 45, we show 4.4 (200/45).
- How am I going?
  - give everyone the possibility to monitor themselves
  - give a summary of the latest work
